## Overview

To work on my vanilla CSS, HTML, and JavaScript skills, I decided to do this Frontend Mentor challenge. I matched the design specifications visually and functionally (but there is no memory of previous months associated with it at the present). At some point I plan on taking this base and expanding it into a functional system for myself in my actual banking.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current dayâ€™s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart
